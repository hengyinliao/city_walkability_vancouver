## **Vancouver Walkability Explorer (15-Minute City) — Interactive Map**

This project adapts an [open-source 15-minute city accessibility workflow](https://github.com/henryspatialanalysis/city_walkability) to **Metro Vancouver**. It estimates walking-time accessibility from neighborhood areas to common daily amenities, including supermarkets, parks, libraries, coffee shops, restaurants, and public transit stops.

Users can select one or multiple destinations using the checklist above. The map updates dynamically to show **which areas offer the shortest walking times** to the nearest selected amenities, helping explore **neighborhood suitability based on everyday needs**.

### **How to use**
* Launch the map [here](https://hengyinliao.github.io/city_walkability_vancouver/visualization_vancouver/).
* Select one or more destination types from the top panel.
* Hover over a neighborhood to view walking-time details.
* Compare neighborhoods using walking-time categories.

### **Data Sources**

* **OpenStreetMap (OSM):** amenity locations and supporting geographic data.
* **TransLink GTFS:** public transit information (bus routes, stops, and schedules) from TransLink’s developer resources.

### **Notes**

* Results reflect walking accessibility based on publicly available data and selected parameters; they do not represent housing affordability, safety, or personal preferences.
* Data and methods are adapted from an existing open-source workflow; all Metro Vancouver results were generated by me.

### **Future Directions**

* **Urban walkability typologies:** cluster neighborhoods based on multi-amenity walking times to identify typical accessibility structures across Metro Vancouver.
* **Daily life scenarios:** evaluate accessibility under different lifestyle bundles (e.g., working adults, elderly residents, families).
* **Accessibility trade-offs:** examine trade-offs between different forms of access (e.g., transit versus green space).
* **Action priorities:** develop intervention priority scores to identify areas where targeted improvements could yield the greatest benefits.
